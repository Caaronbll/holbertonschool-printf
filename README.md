# holbertonschool-printf
In this repository my partner Rob Hollis and I attempt to recreate the
function "printf()" in C. 

This project's goal was to set up our own version of the printf function.
We named our function printf with an underscore in front.

We used the following format specifiers

- %c prints a single character
- %s prints a single string
- %% prints a percent sign
- %d prints an integer with a signed decimal
- %i prints an integer with a signed decimal

These format specifiers will return the values specified.
